The GitHub Actions workflow has been created successfully. Here's what you need to do to make it work:

1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions):
•  DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username
•  DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub access token
•  SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: Your SSH private key for VPS access
•  SSH_HOST: Your VPS IP address or domain
•  SSH_USERNAME: Your VPS SSH username
2. Ensure you have Docker installed on your VPS
3. Make sure you have a valid Dockerfile in your project root directory. Would you like me to check if there's a Dockerfile or help you create one?

The workflow will:
•  Build and tag your Docker image
•  Push it to Docker Hub
•  SSH into your VPS
•  Pull the new image
•  Stop and remove the old container (if exists)
•  Start a new container with the latest image
•  Clean up old images

Would you like me to:
1. Check if a Dockerfile exists?
2. Help you create a Dockerfile?
3. Make any adjustments to the workflow?
